Japanese government approves first “ethical” human flesh noodle shop
By Benjamin Fulford, CNN*

April 1st, 2016


Tokyo, Japan (CNN) The Japanese government has just approved the establishment of a noodle shop featuring broth made from human bones and flesh, the Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry has announced.
Ministry spokesperson Ku Jinniku explained there were strict guidelines in place to ensure the flesh was acquired from “voluntary donors,” in an “ethical manner.” The flesh must be either body parts taken in a non-life threatening manner from living donors or else from people who signed papers allowing their flesh to be consumed after their deaths, the ministry says.


Most of the meat and bones used in the noodle soup will come from victims of traffic accidents whose body parts are now discarded as medical waste by hospitals, says shop owner E.T. Fleisch. The owners of amputated limbs or family members of accident victims will be paid in exchange for signing over rights to the meat, he said.


The shop has also already been contacted by a volunteer who wants to have one arm amputated at the elbow so that he can enjoy eating it with his friends, he said. The volunteer, Chu Meup, explained his motives to CNN. “First of all, missing an arm below the elbow is the minimum you need to get special handicapped parking rights, so it will be convenient” he said. “Furthermore the new prosthetic lower arm I will install will be superior to his original arm in that it will be internet connected and can be regularly upgraded” he adds. Meup says he eventually hopes to replace all his body parts with artificial substitutes and become immortal. “The last thing to go will be my brain after I download its contents into a memory chip,” he said.


The brain would not be approved for consumption in the noodle shop because of fears of kuru or mad cow disease infection, the ministry spokesperson said.


CNN reporters asked various religious leaders about the ethical implications of eating noodle soup made from human flesh. The Rabbi Letz Eatsum from the West Tokyo Synagogue said it would be kosher if the flesh was Jewish but not otherwise because the goyim are considered to be a type of pork. By contrast the Iman Shish al-Kebab of the East Tokyo Mosque said Muslim flesh was haram but that there would be no problem if it came from infidels. Meanwhile fathers Patrick Fitzgerald and Gerald Fitzpatrick from the Japan Christian choir boys training institute noted that since Christians already practice ritual cannibalism by pretending that bread and wine are the flesh of Jesus that non-ritual cannibalism “would probably OK.”


The noodle shop also got surprising support from vegetarians. “I became a vegetarian because I hate the idea of killing animals against their will just to eat their flesh, however if the meat comes from human volunteers then I would be able to have guilt-free meat,” said French tourist Jemange Desgens.


Not everybody was happy with the idea of allowing the shop to open. “If you have a legal channel to sell human flesh it will not be long before they forging certificates of origin to allow meat laundering of stolen human flesh,” says Nowei Jose from the anti-cannibal league.


For his part, shop owner Fleisch says he hopes eventually to build a world-wide chain of human flesh food shops and restaurants. “Humans will become the most ecologically friendly and ethically sound source of meat on the planet,” he promises.

"Have you ever wondered if maybe your child enters the so called “black statistics”, which are intended for a proposed depopulation of our planet? How can someone be miserable and force people to lead their children to vaccination, even though on the official Food and Drug Administration sites there is a sign that says that vaccines can cause autism?

Is there a single parent on this planet who would risk the life of their child for pharmaceutical mafia which just on a “cocktail of toxins” they earn huge amounts of money, but also performs a depopulation!"
"Trump sure is doing a great job of honoring veterans on Veterans Day. In an interview with reporters aboard Air Force One, he ridiculed U.S. intel leaders and sided with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This week, the useful Warrior Canine Connection program received a shocking letter at the program’s office in the Washington D.C. area. The letter instructed personnel to leave their posts immediately and shut down the program for vets.

They have since closed their offices at Fort Belvoir in Northern Virginia and on the campus of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington.

Warrior Canine Connection Executive Director Rick Yount stated:

“At two o’clock in the afternoon, I received a phone call saying there was a stop work order. There was no explanation whatsoever as to why that was the decision.”

He asked, “Why would — all of the sudden — a program be halted that was serving patients?”

Yount added that he “heard absolutely nothing” about any problems with the program. His contract wasn’t set to expire until 2019.

He reminded Trump officials, “There’s no question that this program saves lives.”

Wounded veterans don’t only depend on service dogs for physical needs; the dogs also provide a therapeutic effect for PTSD symptoms.

What is your reaction?"
"Almost a third of Americans support Donald Trump’s belief that the media is an “enemy of the American people” and favour government restrictions on the press, according to a new survey.

Attacks on the press helped fuel Mr Trump’s presidential campaign, during which he frequently denounced the media and encouraged supporters to jeer reporters at rallies. He has continued to deride unfavorable coverage as “fake news” and assail news organisations that report it.

The President has previously said on Twitter that “ the FAKE NEWS media” was “the enemy of the American people” and the survey found that 31 per cent agreed that the media prevents political leaders from doing their jobs. Those views were especially pronounced among supporters of the President, soaring to nearly two-thirds of respondents, according to the survey of 2,100 Americans carried out in early November by Poynter.

A smaller but still significant number of Americans — roughly a quarter — endorsed allowing the government to halt publication of “a story that government officials say is biased or inaccurate,” an extraordinary rebuke of precedent barring such government control of the media. Despite the embrace of Mr Trump’s anti-press rhetoric, overall views of the media have actually improved. The survey found that just under half of Americans have either a great deal of confidence or a fair amount of confidence in the media, an increase over recent levels.

But that support fractured along party lines, with an overwhelming majority of Democrats (74 per cent) trusting the media against just 19 per cent of Republicans. Democratic faith in the media has surged since Mr Trump’s election."
"As Press Secretary for Donald Trump, Sarah Sanders Huckabee has faced her fair share of media hostility. Lately, however, she’s “never been attacked more.” So she’s striking back in a hilarious way.
“I’ve never been attacked more, questioned more,” Sanders said during a panel held by George Washington University. I was called a liar by a major network in an official statement, I’ve been called outrageous things on air, and it goes unquestioned, no pushback.”

“I do think that there is a greater sense of hostility that I’ve seen in this administration than in previous, and I think that you see that reflected in the numbers, in the coverage,” said Sanders. “If you compare that to the first nine months of the Obama administration, it was 40-60, so for people to pretend like there isn’t a greater sense of hostility toward this administration, I think, would be to ignore real facts.” This tirade against the press forced the Washington Post to fact-check the statement. Their findings were probably hard to swallow for the liberal paper. “93 percent of the coverage [of Trump] was negative and 7 percent positive,” They conceded. “Indeed, studies have shown overwhelmingly negative coverage of Trump in the mainstream media.”

This is a MASTERCLASS in media trolling. The media have to report on Sanders, so she’s using them to wage war against themselves.

Sarah Sanders knows exactly what she’s doing — and she’s doing it REALLY well.

She learned from the best, and now she is the best defender of the president."
"President Donald Trump on Monday signed two executive actions that drastically slash the boundaries of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, and criticized former presidents for their use of the Antiquities Act to designate such monuments. Trump called former President Barack Obama’s designation of Bears Ears an overreach of executive power, even as he unilaterally undid much of the designation himself. President Bill Clinton first designated the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 1996.

At a speech at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City, Trump vowed to oversee a process that would tamp down on what he sees as abuses of the 1906 Antiquities Act, which presidents since Teddy Roosevelt have used to protect environmentally and culturally significant areas.

The proclamations Trump signed reduce the 1.9 million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante monument to 906,000 acres, while Bears Ears, which was 1.35 million acres, will shrink to 228,800 acres.

“These abuses of the Antiquities Act give enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of the people who actually live here, work here and make this place their home,” Trump said.

The move could open the areas to potential commercial and resource development.

“I’m a real estate developer. When they start talking about millions of acres, I say, say it again. That’s a lot,” he told the crowd in Utah.

Trump was flanked by supporters of his move, including Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, whom he encouraged to seek an eighth term.

In the House, Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop, R-Utah, has proposed changing the Antiquities Act and also supports Trump’s actions to shrink the monuments.

However, Native American tribes whose relationships to the monument areas date back centuries have been among the most critical of Trump’s actions.

“Bears Ears has been home to Hopi, Navajo, Ute, Ute Mountain Ute, Zuni, and other Indigenous people since time immemorial. The Bears Ears cultural landscape is important not just for objects of antiquity and fossils studied by scientists, but for the continuation of our Indigenous cultures and our way of life,” tribal leaders said in a statement on Friday.

The move is part of a broader trend in Trump’s first year in office of rolling back parts of Obama’s legacy — and of lambasting presidents past of both parties.

Conservative groups quickly praised Trump’s action, while liberal organizations and lawmakers responded with scorn as they prepped lawsuits to block the move.

“Antiquities designations have stripped economic opportunities away from communities,” Nick Loris of the Heritage Foundation said in a statement.

Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, in a letter to Zinke, criticized the move.

Trump’s decision “puts the future of these resources in jeopardy and threatens our culture, history, and heritage. And if President Donald Trump decides to use the Antiquities Act to reverse one of these monuments, he is going to be treading in uncharted waters,” Durbin told Zinke. “These monuments are for all of us, and we must ensure that they remain in their natural condition for current and future generations to enjoy.”

Last December, upon making the national monument designations, Obama said the move would “help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes.”"
"Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is zeroing in on Donald Trump’s business dealings. The former reality show star refused to release his tax returns during the campaign and after he was inaugurated but Mueller is following the money trail. Deutsche Bank is known for money laundering for Russia and Trump owes the bank a fuckton of money, as does his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The bank received a subpoena from Mueller several weeks ago to provide information on certain money and credit transactions, a source told Reuters, confirming a report by German daily Handelsblatt which was published on Tuesday.

Germany’s largest bank has loaned the Trump organization millions of dollars for real estate ventures, and yet, the former reality show star cannot get a loan in the U.S. In June, House Democrats requested details from Deutsche Bank of Trump’s finances but that was rejected.

Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and the hostile foreign government.

Indictments have been issued and plea deals have been made with two of Trump’s former associates.

Mueller was looking into Trump’s business transactions as part of his ongoing probe in July and in response to that, Trump warned the special counsel that expanding the probe to his business ties would cross a line. That’s like saying, “Whatever you do, DO NOT LOOK AT MY FINANCES!” thus telling Mueller exactly where to look. We should be thankful at times like this that Trump has a big mouth.

Trump has not tweeted yet this morning but we’re sure it will be a doozy when he does. He can run but he can’t hide from Mr. Mueller."
"The number of immigrants apprehended for non-criminal violations has skyrocketed in the first year of the Trump administration, even as the number of people arrested at the border for entering the U.S. illegally has dropped to its lowest level in decades.

Immigrants taken into custody on administrative grounds jumped 42 percent since President Donald Trump took office in January, according to end-of-year data released Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security. Immigration offenses such as entering the U.S. illegally for the first time are civil, not criminal, violations.

President Donald Trump has regularly promised to ramp up immigration enforcement, a priority that was a central plank of his election campaign. On Tuesday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting Director Thomas Homan lauded the increase in administrative arrests and praised his agency's officers, declaring that ""the numbers show that they operate with perfection on the president's mandate.""

In an apparent pointed reference to the Obama administration, Homan said that the figures ""prove that ICE officers know how to prioritize without overly prescriptive mandates,"" adding, ""I couldn't be prouder of the men and women of ICE."" The number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally who were arrested for administrative violations rose to 110,568 in fiscal 2017, up from 77,806 for the same period last year. Although fiscal 2017 includes a roughly three-month period from October through early January when Obama was still in office, the number of administrative arrests sharply increased after Trump took office.

Immigration advocacy and support groups have criticized the Trump administration for unleashing what they say is an immigration enforcement regime that makes little distinction between people who are in the U.S. illegally who have criminal charges – and, therefore, may pose a threat to the communities they're in – and those who are here with simply civil violations.Homan, who has forcefully defended ICE and the Trump administration's immigration enforcement measures and who was last month tapped to become ICE's permanent director, pushed back on that claim Tuesday.

Of those apprehended by ICE overall, 92 percent ""had criminal convictions, were an immigration fugitive or were an illegal re-entry … which is a felony,"" he said, adding that that figure ""is pretty much perfection in the execution.""

The large increase in administrative arrests, he continued, reflects the shift in priorities from the Obama administration – which had directed ICE to focus on those accused or convicted of serious crimes – to the Trump administration, which rolled back its predecessor's directives.

""When you go from 0 to 100, you're going to see a large increase,"" Homan said. ""This president, like him or love him, is doing the right thing. People can argue all you want about priorities and policies.""The press conference seemed designed in many ways to hammer home that message – as well as the broad support that the president has from top immigration officers. Officials in suits, and a couple in uniform, lined the walls of the briefing room, and reporters were provided lengthy packets detailing the latest statistics.

The surge in administrative arrests comes after a decline in arrests of people entering the U.S. illegally at the Southwest border, which immigration authorities cite as a benchmark for illegal immigration overall.

Customs and Border Protection, which oversees enforcement at the ports and along the border, recorded 310,531 apprehensions in fiscal 2017, a nearly 24-percent drop from the previous fiscal year and the lowest total since 1971. Arrests in the four-month period between Trump's inauguration and April, in particular, dropped by 40 percent compared to the same period last year, according to CBP.

Apprehensions, however, began to rise again starting in May. CBP acting Deputy Director Ron Vitiello attributed the steady uptick to ""legal or policy loopholes which are exploited by transnational criminal and smuggling organizations which are involved in human trafficking."""
"Gangs of blacks are targeting Walmart departments stores and other outlets all across the country in targeted attacks while terrorizing on shoppers and perpetrating retail theft and property damage, police say.

The latest black mob was a planned attack on a Walmart in Macon, Georgia on Tuesday where shoppers were injured — including a disabled man in a motorized wheelchair — merchandise was destroyed and stolen, and at least one arrest was made.

The group of about 50 blacks ransacked the Macon Walmart causing an estimated $2,000 in damage, all in an effort to “see how much damage” they could wreak. During the 1:45 AM attack, mobbing blacks pulled a disabled man from his wheelchair and threw him to the floor.

A black suspect who was later arrested reportedly told a Walmart employee: “This was a planned event, and that they had planned to see how much damage they could cause.”

Police arrested 17-year-old Kharron Nathan Green, of Ashton Drive in northwest Bibb County, when he returned to the store to look for a cell phone he had dropped. Store employees identified him to police.

This isn’t the first time a store was targeted for a black mob assault. It’s a criminal phenomenon that’s becoming increasingly common.

To name but a few instances, last year a Memphis Kroger grocery store was beset upon by a mob of blacks who caroused through the store stealing and damaging things. And in that case, blacks brutally beat a store employee.

In February, a Florida shopping mall was swarmed by hundreds of rampaging blacks. Despite that hundreds participated in the attack, only one suspect was arrested.

For several years, mobs of black teens have targeted and swarmed convenience stores, small clothing stores and gas stations, while destroying, stealing from, and attacking employees and patrons."
"AARON MATÉ: It's The Real News. I'm Aaron Maté. President Trump has sparked outrage over his latest display of solidarity with white bigots. On Wednesday, Trump retweeted three posts from the fringe British far-right group, Britain First. These posts all contained anti-Muslim content. This prompted the group's deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, to express her thanks.
JAYDA FRANSEN: This is a message to the President of the United States, Donald Trump. I'd like to start by saying how delighted I am that as the leader of the free world, you took the time out to retweet three of my videos on Twitter today.
AARON MATÉ: Fransen faces charges in the U.K. for inciting hate against Muslims. The White House has not apologized for Trump's retweet. In fact, White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, defended it.
S. HUCKABEE SANDERS: Whether it's a real video, the threat is real and that is what the President is talking about. That's what the President is focused on, is dealing with those real threats and those are real no matter how you look at it.
Press 1: It doesn't matter [crosstalk 00:01:16] if the video is fake?
S. HUCKABEE SANDERS: Look, I'm not talking about the nature of the video. I think you're focusing on the wrong thing. The threat is real.
AARON MATÉ: Joining me now is Gerald Horne, historian and professor of African-American studies at the University of Houston. Professor Horne, we've had you on many times since Trump took office to discuss his sympathy and defense of white supremacists. Didn't seem fathomable that he could take it to a new level, but with this latest round of retweets, it appears like he has. Your thoughts on Trump's actions here.
GERALD HORNE: Well, you may recall that approximately a year ago Mr. Trump was elected with 63 million votes and an argument erupted in progressive circles as to whether or not [inaudible 00:02:05] that propels so many to vote for him, or whether it was racial animus. Fast forward to November, December 2017, and I think we have an answer. That is to say, as a massive tax cut for the wealthy is making its way through Congress, redistributing wealth from bottom to top, you see that a good number of Trump's base are not getting the benefit of that tax cut, but they are getting the ""benefit "" of racism.
That is to say, that they are getting tweet storms demonizing Muslims, demonizing immigrants, demonizing Black athletes, demonizing Latinos and Mexicans, and I think we now have that answer to what was posed in November, 2016. I think only the naïve would now suggest that racism was not a factor, not only in the election of Donald Trump, but also in helping to solidify his base. Because as you know, there has been hardly a crack in his base. They are still with him for the most part.
AARON MATÉ: My only question there is whether the base is so easily deluded that they're not even being made aware of all the policies that Trump is doing that undermine all of his various promises to fix the dire economic straits that they were in.
GERALD HORNE: Well, you may know that in the election in Virginia, which was a kind of referendum on Trump, it is true that Ed Gillespie, the Republican nominee for governor, who half embraced Trump, lost. Now keep in mind, that if you look at a map of the state of Virginia, which Hillary Clinton won by a few points, you will see a mostly red map. That is to say, that Ed Gillespie, the Trump-backed candidate basically won the white vote, which should not come as a surprise to anyone who paid even negligible attention to U.S. politics. I think we should not delude ourselves about the United States of America.
We should not try to convince ourselves that what we are seeing is not actually taking place. Go back a quarter of a century when David Duke, a clan leader and neo-Nazi, ran for Governor of Louisiana and got 55 to 60% of the white base. Once again, a debate erupted as to whether or not it was economic anxiety that caused so many Euro-Americans to vote for a clansman. That may have been a factor, but what happens is that, generally speaking, I think many of our friends on the left were uncomfortable talking about racism, so they tend to either discuss it abstractly, or sweep it under the rug.
AARON MATÉ: Fair enough. I should clarify, I don't mean at all to suggest that racism was not a major factor in Trump's election. I guess, I as someone who identifies with the left, am uncomfortable when economic issues are totally cast aside, where it becomes sort of either/or instead of both.
GERALD HORNE: Well, certainly it's both, but with regard to those 63 million who we supposedly have to convince to pursue their class interests. Apparently, they are not interested in pursuing their class interests, which means we have to look for alternatives. Otherwise, we'll have a lot of time to discuss these issues in an internment camp in Yankee Stadium, for example. What this suggests, is that we should pay much more attention to the international situation. I think part of the danger of what Trump has done, is that he is whipping up right-wing sentiment in Europe, particularly in Great Britain.
You may recall that just a few days ago in Warsaw Poland there was 60,000 marching under a frankly neo-fascist banner calling for ""Islamic holocaust."" What's striking about that Warsaw protest was how Donald Trump's words were invoked. That is to say, that I think it's long past time for we in the United States to recognize that the country in which we're residing is now the clearest threat to international peace and security, and in many ways is the right-wing anchor of the global community.
AARON MATÉ: Right. As a historian, can you talk about the history of using anti-immigrant sentiment and racism in general towards consolidating the power of domestic elites, especially here in the U.S.?
GERALD HORNE: Well, there are so many examples to choose from, one hardly knows where to start. Let's start in the 1890s with the so-called populist movement. That term does not have the pejorative connotation it does today. I'm speaking of populism. It was a grassroots movement principally of agricultural workers and farmers who were railing against being exploited by the railroads, which were dominated by Robber Barons. Strikingly enough, Tom Watson of Georgia, who was a Euro-American leader of the populist movement, basically was ... He reversed field and became a leader of the white supremacist movement.
What's striking about Tom Watson and what happened in Georgia was that by 1915, they were not only lynching Black Americans, which they had been doing for some years, they also lynched a Jewish man, Leo Frank, which of course helped to bring many affluent Jewish people in New York into the movement for civil rights, helping to back the then newly born NAACP. This question of using racism as a tool, of course, arises most dramatically perhaps in the 1960s with the so-called Southern Strategy of Richard M. Nixon.
That is to say, the Republican party recognized that after President Lyndon Baines Johnson had pushed through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finally guaranteeing the right of Black Americans and others the right to vote, that there would be a so-called white backlash, which of course then ensued, which then sunk movements not only for equality going forward, but also movements of class solidarity. That is to say, building trade unions, which still I might argue should be a leading priority today.
AARON MATÉ: Right. When Trump retweets an account from an avowed Islamophobe like that leader of the group, Britain First, do you think he's making a thought-out calculation, an attempt to appeal to his base? I mean, how cynical and calculated do you think his whole fueling of racists sentiments is?
GERALD HORNE: Well, it's difficult to say. I'd have to get him on the couch and do a psychoanalysis to get a precise answer, but going on the evidence that we have before us, I think it's a very cynical manipulation. Keep in mind as well, that in recent days according to close advisors quoted off the record, Trump has talked about reviving the so-called birther controversy, the idea that Barack Obama, the previous president was not born in the United States, which would have made him illegitimate in terms of being a U.S. President.
Mr. Trump backed down from that about 14 months ago, but now he sees the need to whip it up again. It's apparent that this is a cynical manipulation. That is to say, as the plutocrats get tax cuts, and benefits, and wealth raked and shoveled into their bulging pockets, the working-class and middle-class base of Mr. Trump gets tweet storms about racism, gets birther controversies, which obviously they feel is something they need. Otherwise, we'd see in the polls that they had rebelled against him.
AARON MATÉ: We'll leave it there. Professor Gerald Horne of the University of Houston, thanks very much.
GERALD HORNE: Thank you.
AARON MATÉ: Thank you for joining us on The Real News."
"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. B-1B Lancer bombers will fly over the Korean peninsula on Wednesday as part of a large-scale joint aerial drill being staged with South Korea this week, the South’s Yonhap news agency reported, citing an unidentified military source. The bombers will take part in the drills at a time of heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula and as United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman makes a rare visit to North Korea. Some analysts and diplomats hope Feltman’s visit to the North could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse rising international tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs. Feltman, a former senior U.S. State Department official, is the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday he was not carrying any message from Washington during his visit.

The drills, which started on Monday and will run until Friday, come after North Korea tested last week what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could reach all of the United States.

South Korean government officials, including President Moon Jae-in, have said the North’s latest ICBM is their most capable yet, although it has several critical points to prove, such as re-entry technology and terminal stage guidance.

A South Korean defense ministry official was unable to immediately verify the Yonhap report about the U.S. B-1B Lancer bombers taking part in the drills on Wednesday.

The annual joint exercise, called “Vigilant Ace”, has been designed to enhance readiness and operational capability and to ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula, officials have said. Around 12,000 U.S. service members, including from the Marines and Navy, will join South Korean troops.

Aircraft taking part will be flown from eight U.S. and South Korean military installations.

The U.S. Air Force has said the size of this year’s drill is “comparable” to previous years.

North Korea has vehemently criticized the drills since the weekend, saying the exercise “precipitates” the United States’ and South Korea’s “self-destruction”.

China and Russia had proposed that the United States and South Korea stop major military exercises in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs. Beijing formally calls the idea the “dual suspension” proposal.

Russia has communication channels open with North Korea and Moscow is ready to exert its influence on Pyongyang, RIA news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov as saying on Tuesday.

North Korea’s state media confirmed the arrival of Feltman and his entourage late on Tuesday without offering more details.

The North has warned the drills would push the Korean peninsula to “the brink of nuclear war”."
